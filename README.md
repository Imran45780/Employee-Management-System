# Employee-Management-System
The Employee Management System is a Java-based console application developed using Hibernate ORM to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. This project demonstrates how Hibernate simplifies database interaction by mapping Java objects to relational database tables and eliminating boilerplate JDBC code.
